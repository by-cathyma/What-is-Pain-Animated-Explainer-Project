# What-is-Pain-Animated-Explainer-Project
An animated explainer made for The Alfred Hospital on 'What is Pain?' in CDS2001.
Having chose the project brief What is pain? for The Alfred Hospital, my main aim was to create an animated explainer video that was informative, yet
engaging. I felt that most informative videos coming out of health care institutions lacked a sense of visual engagement, and may have come off as
bland or information heavy. To combat this with my own style, I wanted to create an animation that was more visually stimulating and carried a sort of
narrative. The style that I ended up leaning towards was done with intention. Because I had chosen the voiceover done by a young child, I wanted to maintain a playful essence throughout the video. In doing so, the stylistic elements of the animated explainer are more cartoon-esque and a little comedic. It utilises the tool of characterisations and simple visual metaphors as to be easily understood or digested.
